About the Book
Pair Programming with ChatGPT: AI-Enhanced Coding for the Modern Developer is a book that explores the exciting world of using artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to assist in software development.

One of the key themes of the book is the role that AI can play as your pair programming partner, and how it can enhance the process of writing code. I explore specific ways that AI can be used to help with complex algorithms, coding styles, and unit tests, considering both the potential benefits and challenges of using AI in these areas.

In the book, I make use of various technologies such as JavaScript, Angular, and Ionic. While these tools are helpful in demonstrating certain concepts, it is important to note that their use is not essential to understanding the fundamental ideas. Readers who may not be familiar with these technologies need not worry, as the concepts discussed can still be comprehended without an in-depth knowledge of these specific tools. The focus of the book is on the underlying principles and ideas, and the technologies mentioned are merely a means to an end in illustrating these concepts.

This book is a ChatGPT-specific version of my first AI title, P-AI-R Programming. Much of the content is the same, updated for GPT-4. If you already own the first book, sign up for the bonus materials so you'll see how you can upgrade to this one.

So come join me on this journey as we explore the future of software development and learn how to use AI to take our skills to the next level.
